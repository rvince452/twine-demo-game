:: loc-lance-farm {"position":"100,100","size":"150,100"}
The 50-acre Lance farm stretches across rolling hills planted mostly with soybeans, though weeds have begun to reclaim the edges where the old equipment can't quite reach. Rusted fence posts lean at odd angles, connected by sagging wire that hums strangely in the wind. The property has an unsettling quality in the early morning mist, as if the land itself remembers things better left forgotten.

:: loc-pool {"position":"250,100","size":"150,100"}
The swimming pool sits between the main house and the forest like an abandoned promise from better times. The once-blue water has turned a murky green-brown, with leaves and debris floating on the surface that ripples without any apparent cause. The concrete edges are cracked and stained, and the diving board hangs at a precarious angle, its metal joints corroded by years of neglect.

:: loc-poolhouse {"position":"400,100","size":"150,100"}
The poolhouse stands as a weathered monument to the family's former prosperity, its wood siding warped and paint peeling in long strips. Inside, the air is thick with mustiness and the scent of something indefinably wrong—perhaps old chlorine mixed with decay. Broken pool equipment leans against the walls like sleeping creatures, and strange shadows seem to move in the corners even on bright days.

:: loc-forest {"position":"100,250","size":"150,100"}
A dense band of trees stretches from behind the main house to the northern edge of the property, their branches intertwining overhead to create an unnatural twilight beneath. The forest floor is carpeted with rotting leaves that squelch underfoot, releasing an earthy smell tinged with something sickly sweet. Local wildlife seems to avoid this area, leaving an eerie silence broken only by the occasional crack of dead wood settling.

:: loc-cemetery {"position":"250,250","size":"150,100"}
The old cemetery predates the Lance family's ownership, its weathered headstones tilting at unsettling angles like broken teeth. The legal agreement requires its preservation, but nature and time have made their own modifications—vines curl around crumbling monuments and sinkholes have opened where the earth has settled strangely. On foggy evenings, the place seems to breathe with its own rhythm, separate from the living world.

:: loc-machine-shed {"position":"400,250","size":"150,100"}
The machine shed houses a graveyard of farm equipment in various states of decay and repair, their metal surfaces bearing the orange-brown patina of rust and time. Oil stains on the concrete floor form patterns that seem almost deliberate, and the workshop area is cluttered with tools that look like they haven't been properly organized since the Carter administration. The fluorescent lights flicker erratically, casting moving shadows that make the machinery appear to shift and breathe. Along the walls hang an extensive collection of farming implements that double as weapons—rusted scythes with edges still sharp enough to gleam, pitchforks with tines bent at unnatural angles, chainsaws that start on the first pull despite their age, and shovels whose blades bear stains that soap can't seem to wash away.


:: loc-barn {"position":"100,400","size":"150,100"}
The two-story barn looms near the main house, its weathered wood siding adorned with faded hex signs—traditional wards against ill fortune and spirits that now seem more desperate than protective. The structure creaks and settles with sounds that don't quite match the wind patterns, and the second-story window that aligns with the main house bedroom has a strange quality to its glass, distorting views in unsettling ways. Hay bales are stacked haphazardly inside, some showing signs of inexplicable moisture despite the sound roof.

:: loc-dougs-cabin {"position":"250,400","size":"150,100"}
Doug's cabin sits 2,000 feet from the main house like a hermit's retreat, its log walls chinked with a mixture of mud and what might be other materials. The structure appears solid but somehow wrong—windows that don't quite align, a roof that seems to sag in the middle despite strong supports, and a front porch that groans under even light footsteps. Smoke from the chimney sometimes drifts in directions that defy the wind, and strange sounds emanate from within during the quiet hours.

:: loc-corn-maze {"position":"400,400","size":"150,100"}
The three-acre corn maze north of the main house has evolved beyond human planning, as countless footpaths to Doug's cabin and the machine shed have created a labyrinthine network through the stalks. Six figures stand guard throughout the field, supposedly scarecrows but wearing an odd assortment of human clothing—a woman's floral dress, a man's suit jacket with the sleeves cut off, children's winter coats in bright colors now faded by seasons of weather. Their faces are stitched burlap, but the expressions seem to shift when you're not looking directly at them. Sometimes, on still days, you can see them turning their heads to track your movement through the maze, their straw-stuffed limbs creaking softly in the absence of any wind.

:: loc-forest-clearing-firepits
Deep within the forest lies a circular clearing where three large fire pits are arranged in a triangular pattern. Each pit is carefully constructed from local fieldstone and filled with partially burned logs and kindling that never seems to fully turn to ash. The surrounding trees bear strange carvings—symbols that don't match any known language, carved deep enough to weep sap that has hardened into amber-colored tears. The ground around the pits is packed hard from many feet, and sometimes you can find small bones scattered in the ashes, too small to be human but too large to belong to any local wildlife.

:: loc-police-station-abandoned
The station was closed down but is used by troopers passing through to rest or make some phone calls. Today there is a strange note awaiting the next trooper. It directs them to the Lance farm.
