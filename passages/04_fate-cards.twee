The crude illustration depicts a white stick figure walking with arms outstretched, approaching the edge of a field represented by vertical lines (corn stalks). Behind the figure, a black stick figure holds a long staff or wand, pointing it toward the white figure. Birds fly overhead as simple V-shapes, and a small house sits in the distance.

A white stick figure kneels beside a simple house shape, holding a brush or tool toward the wall. Above, in a square window of the house, a black stick figure can be seen looking down. Nearby on the ground are simple objects: a bucket (circle), and what appears to be paint or liquid spilling from it in wavy lines.
